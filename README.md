bucket-place
============

Solver to the DataGenetics coffee time buckets problem.

"10) Buckets

Challenge: Put the numbers 1-13 into three buckets with the constraint that the difference between any two pairs of numbers in any bucket is not a number also in that bucket. (e.g. If you place 5,7 in a bucket, then you cannot place 2 in that same bucket)."
